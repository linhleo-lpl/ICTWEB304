      <h3>Exercise involves engaging in physical activity and increasing the heart rate beyond resting levels. It is an important part of preserving physical and mental health.</h3>
<p>Whether people engage in light exercise, such as going for a walk, or high intensity activities, for example, uphill cycling or weight training, regular exercise provides a huge range of benefits for the body and mind.<br>
Taking part in exercise of any intensity every day is essential for preventing a range of diseases and other health issues.<br><br>
In this article, we explain the different types of exercise and their benefits, as well as the considerations for designing a fitness regime.</p><hr/>

      <h3>Types and benefits</h3>

         "_anaerobic<br/>"+
         "_agility training<br/>";
      }

<h3>Risks of not exercising</h3>
<p id="demo1"></p>
<button type="button" onclick="myFunction1()">Find out more</button>
<script>
function myFunction1() {
  document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML =
  "A sedentary lifestyle can increase the risk of the following health problems:<br/><br/>"+
  "_cardiovascular disease<br/>"+
  "_type 2 diabetes<br/>"+
  "_cancer<br/>"+
  "_osteoporosis<br/><br/>"+
  "It can also contribute to an increased risk of premature death from all causes, including the complications of being overweight and obesity.<br/><br/>"+
  "In many parts of the world, including the United States, the number of overweight and obese people continues to increase rapidly.<br/>";

<h3>Finding time to exercise</h3>

  document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML =
  "Fitting exercise into a busy schedule can be a roadblock to a successful regime. However, people do not need to dedicate large amounts of extra time to exercise to see the benefits.<br/><br/>"+

  "Here are some tips for fitting physical activity in a busy schedule:<br/><br/>"+"    "+

  "_See which car journeys you can replace with walking or cycling. Is driving to work necessary? If so, try parking half a mile away from the office and walking the final bit.<br/>"+
  "_People who commute to work by public transport could try getting off their bus or train a few stops early and walking the rest of the way.<br/>"+
  "_Consider walking up and down the stairs at your office instead of taking elevators or escalators.<br/>"+
  "_Try to think about the amount of time spent watching television and avoid binge-watching TV shows. While watching television for extended periods, light exercises, such as stomach crunches or jumping jacks, can help a person include more physical activity in their day.<br/>"+
  "_If a person enjoys video games, they could consider playing games that encourage physical activity, such as exercise routines on a Nintendo Wii.<br/>"+
  "_Vigorous housework, gardening, and going up and down the stairs while doing chores also qualify as physical activity and can help people meet the guidelines productively.<br/><br/>"+
  "People will likely gain the most benefit from exercises they enjoy that fit their lifestyle.<br/><br/>"+
  
  "_Some of the examples below are the easiest to fit into a daily routine:<br/>"+
  "_Go for a brisk 30-minute walk five times every week.<br/>"+
  "_Walk your dog more often or go for walks and jogs with friends.<br/>"+
  "_Try to add swimming to your weekly routine, even if it is not every day.<br/>"+
  "_Join some exercise classes that are fun, collaborative, and educational.<br/>"+
  "_Become a member of a martial arts club. Beginner’s sessions can be gentle and fun.<br/><br/>"+
  "Exercise is sometimes a gradual learning curve. A person should spread sessions across the week and scale up the intensity slowly.<br/><br/>"+

  "It is important for people to ensure they drink plenty of water during and after exercise. Checking with a doctor is a good precaution to take if someone has a health condition or injury that could impact exercise levels, or that exercise could make worse.<br/><br/>"+

  "While a combination of aerobic and anaerobic exercise provides the most benefit, any exercise is better than none for people who currently have an inactive lifestyle.<br/>";

<h3>Tips for starting</h3>
<p id="demo3"></p>
<button type="button" onclick="myFunction3()">Find out more</button>
<script>
function myFunction3() {
  document.getElementById("demo3").innerHTML =
"Exercise may be difficult to maintain for some people. Consider the following tips to achieve long-term success:<br/><br/>"+

"_Have a clear goal: Whether for health reasons or otherwise, try to always keep in mind the reason you started increasing your exercise levels.<br/>"+
"_Work at your own pace: Doing too much too quickly can increase the risk of injury and the chance to develop a stable routine. Set targets based on the goals you established at the start of the regimen and celebrate small wins to boost confidence.<br/>"+
"_Enjoy yourself: A regimen is more sustainable if a person enjoys the physical activities that it involves.<br/>"+
"_Join a club with a friend: If you join a fitness club with a friend, or exercise with a friend, you may enjoy the sessions more. Some people prefer not to have the stress of someone else around. This depends on you.<br/>"+
"_Trainers and teachers can be helpful: People just starting a regimen or looking to step up their routine may benefit from a personal trainer or teacher. They can provide motivation and guidance, helping people track their goals and stay dedicated.<br/>"+
"_Vary your exercises: Change your exercise program every few weeks. Mixing it up can help a person work on different muscle groups and increase the range of benefits. If you enjoy one particular exercise, such as running, try changing the speed and distance of a run, or follow a different route with more hills.<br/>"+
"_Make it a habit: After a few weeks of regularity, an exercise routine starts to become a habit, even if you find it difficult or boring at first.<br/><br/>"+
"The benefits of regular physical activity are wide-reaching and should form a part of every person’s day to help them remain healthy.";
